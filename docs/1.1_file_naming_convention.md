# Exercise 1.1 file naming convention
Exercises Section 1.1.1

Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from page 2.

### Solution:
`man g++` to get the documentation

- C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header (default), or C, C++ header file to be turned into an Ada spec (via the -fdump-ada-spec switch).
    - file.h

- C source code that must be preprocessed.
    - file.c

- C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header or Ada spec.
    - file.hh
    - file.H
    - file.hp
    - file.hxx
    - file.hpp
    - file.HPP
    - file.h++
    - file.tcc

- C++ source code that must be preprocessed.  Note that in .cxx, the last two letters must both be literally x.  Likewise, .C refers to a literal capital C.
    - file.cc
    - file.cp
    - file.cxx
    - file.cpp
    - file.CPP
    - file.c++
    - file.C
