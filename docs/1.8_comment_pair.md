# Exercise 1.8
Exercises Section 1.3

Indicate which, if any, of the following output statements are legal:
```
std::cout << "/*";
std::cout << "*/";
std::cout << /* "*/" */;
std::cout << /* "*/" /* "/*" */;
```
After youâ€™ve predicted what will happen, test your answers by compiling a program with each of these statements. Correct any errors you encounter.

# Solutions:
`std::cout << "/*";`
- legal

`std::cout << "*/";`
- legal

`std::cout << /* "*/" */;`
- illegal: `/* "*/` is one comment pair which causes `" */` illegal

`std::cout << /* "*/" /* "/*" */;`
- legal: `/* "*/`, `" /* "`, `/*" */`
- A comment begins with `/*` ends with the next `*/`.
- String begins with `"`, ends with `"` regardless of `/*` inside it.
