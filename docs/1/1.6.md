If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?

### Solutions:
not legal. Semicolon indicates the end of a statement. It causes the first `<<` operator in `<< " and " << v2;` lacks of left operand.

Remove the first two semicolon to fix the program.
