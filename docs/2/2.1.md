# Exercise 2.1
Exercises section 2.1.1

What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

### Solution:
- Size: short <= int <= long <= long long
- Unsigned: weight of each bit is $2^i$ (i is from 0 to w - 1), signed: weight of each bit except most significant bit is the same as unsigned, while most significant bit weight is $-2^{w-1}$
- float: 4 bytes, double: 8 bytes
